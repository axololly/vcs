# Version Control System

I got my heart broken so to distract myself, I decided to write a version control system in Rust.

Obviously, because you can't code when you're sad, the first iteration of this was terrible, so I remade it.

## This isn't real!

This is a GitHub mirror of my local Fossil repository, just in case I manage to nuke it off my disk, and also to showcase my friends. I doubt I'll be able to do anything meaningful with issues and PRs but still make them so I know what to fix and what to improve. If this gets enough traction, I can always just switch to Git.
